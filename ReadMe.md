# Intro to Computer Systems Repository
This repository contains various C and ARM Assembly assignments I completed for Intro to Computer Systems (CMSC 216) at Montgomery College in the Fall 2021 semester.
## Projects
### Project 1 - Simulated CPU
Implement an assembly language interpreter for a simple simulated CPU.
#### Objectives:
- Create a "simple" program in C
- Begin to build familiarity with Assembly opcodes
- Consider the distinction between registers and memory
- Process input from Standard Input (STDIN)
### Project 2 - Dungeon Crawl
Implement a "simple" dungeon simulation in C.
### Objectives:
- Process data from Standard Input (STDIN)
- Allocate and manage memory dynamically
- Build and traverse arbitrarily complex data-structures in memory
### Project 3 - Binary Search Trees
Implement an API for Bianry Search Trees in C.
#### Objectives:
- Use C dynamica memory management functions - malloc & free
- Implement a data structure using structs and pointers
- Practice with recursion
### Project 4 - C to Assembly Language
Convert a number of C-subroutines into VisUAL compatible ARM Assembly Language.
#### Objectives:
- Understand Assembly language code
- Explore the difference between higher-level language and Assembly
### Project 5 - Assembly Language II
Write an assembly language program that accesses and makes use of C-subroutines.
#### Objectives:
- Understand Assembly language code
- Interfacing C and Assembly code
### Project 6 - uShell
Build a micro-shell for executing command-line programs.
#### Objectives:
- Understand processes and job control
- Learn to interface with more advanced system calls
- Increase familiarity with operating system functionality
### Project 7 - Multi-Threading
Use threads to create concurrenlty executable code.
#### Objectives:
- Learn how to write a multi-threaded program
- Learn how to build multi-thread safe data structures
